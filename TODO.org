* Cookie optimization

  Once an IP has been approved, module sets a cookie with an access
  token. Further lookups start by looking for this token in the cookie. If
  module sees token, it skips the SQLite lookup and allows the request to
  proceed. Token is a hash of remote IP and internally generated UUID. Therefore
  client cannot guess token. UUID can be regenerated every hour or whatever time
  frame (perhaps set in configuration). So cookies can go stale. This
  optimization makes is such that only one query per hour (or UUID) is required
  for a given IP.
