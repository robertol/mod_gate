\section intro Introduction
 
The mod_gate C/C++ source code documentation. From a doxygen perspective. The
code is not commented well. Really, you should just read the source code
directly. Nevertheless, Doxygen can still be helpful. The major Apache classes
are well commented -- apache::Request, apache::Server, etc. But the rest is hit
or miss.
